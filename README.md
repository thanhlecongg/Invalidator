```

## 🔧 Installations
### Conda
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

- Activate conda:
```
source /opt/conda/bin/activate
```
- Activate Invalidator's conda enviroment: 
```
conda activate invalidator
```

## 🚀 Replication
To replicate the results in our paper, please use the following command
```
python3 experiment.py --c [classifier: 0: semantic, 1: syntactic, 2:combine]
                          --T [threshold of syntactic classifier] 
```
- Option "--c": Invalidator provide three option for classifier including:
    - semantic: With this `semantic` options, Invalidator use semantic classifier which assess the correctness of APR-generated patches via program invariants inferred from Daikon and two proposed overfitting rules (See Section 4.1 in our paper);
    - syntactic: With this `syntatic` options, Invalidator use syntatic classifier which assess the correctness of APR-generated patches via CodeBERT representation and a Logistic Regression classifier (See Section 4.2 in our paper);
    - combine: This is a default option, which use both semantic and syntactic classifiers to assess the correctness of APR-generated patches. 
    
 - Option "--T": This option define the classification threshold for our syntactic classifier
    - By default, this option is set as 0.975;
    - Users can change this threshold depeding on their purpose.
